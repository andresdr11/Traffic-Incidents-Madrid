# Madrid Traffic Incidents Analysis (Data Cleaning)

## Notebook Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a detailed analysis of traffic incidents in Madrid using Python, Pandas, and Data Visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn). The analysis aims to demonstrate insights about trends, patterns and contributing factors to traffic incidents within the Madrid area.

## Objective
The primary objective is to explore and understand the characteristics of traffic incidents, identify hotspots, and showcase the importance of doing a correct data cleaning process before a complete analysis of a database

## Process
### Data Loading
The notebook starts by loading the traffic incident dataset, checking for data types, and ensuring data consistency.

### Data Cleaning
Various data cleaning techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to visualize the distribution of incidents over time, identify peak hours, and explore the types of incidents that frequently occur.

### Spatial Analysis
Geospatial visualizations are used to identify traffic incident hotspots on the map of Madrid, providing insights into areas with higher incident density.


### Severity Analysis
The severity of incidents is explored, considering factors such as accident types and collision severity.
